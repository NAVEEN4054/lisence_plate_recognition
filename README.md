# License Plate Detection and Recognition

This project demonstrates a license plate detection and recognition system using OpenCV, EasyOCR, and Python. The system detects the license plate in an image, extracts the text using optical character recognition (OCR), and overlays the detected text on the original image.

## Introduction

License plate detection and recognition is a technology used in various applications such as traffic management, security, and automation. This project utilizes OpenCV for image processing and EasyOCR for text recognition to build a simple but effective license plate recognition system.

## Installation

To run this project, you need to have Python installed along with the required libraries. Follow the steps below to set up the environment:

1. Clone the repository:
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/yourusername/license-plate-detection.git
    cd license-plate-detection
    ```

2. Create and activate a virtual environment (optional but recommended):
    ```bash
    python -m venv env
    source env/bin/activate  # On Windows, use `env\Scripts\activate`
    ```

3. Install the required dependencies:
    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

## Usage

To use the license plate detection and recognition system, run the provided Python script. Here's an example usage:

```bash
python detect_license_plate.py --image path/to/your/image.jpg
```

## Applications

License plate detection and recognition can be applied in various fields, including:

* **Traffic Management:** Automated monitoring of vehicles for traffic regulation enforcement.
* **Security:** Surveillance systems to track vehicles entering or leaving a facility.
* **Parking Management:** Automated entry and exit systems in parking lots.
* **Toll Collection:** Automated toll booths that recognize vehicle license plates for payment processing.
